 *
 * Any state can transition to FAILED.
 *
 * Calling start() while a component is in states STARTING_PREP, STARTING or
 * STARTED has no effect.
 *
 * Calling start() while a component is in state NEW will cause init() to be
 * called immediately after the start() method is entered.
 *
 * Calling stop() while a component is in states STOPPING_PREP, STOPPING or
 * STOPPED has no effect.
 *
 * Calling stop() while a component is in state NEW transitions the component
 * to STOPPED. This is typically encountered when a component fails to start and
 * does not start all its sub-components. When the component is stopped, it will
 * try to stop all sub-components - even those it didn't start.
 *
 * Attempting any other transition will throw {@link LifecycleException}.
 *
 * </pre>
 * The {@link LifecycleEvent}s fired during state changes are defined in the
 * methods that trigger the changed. No {@link LifecycleEvent}s are fired if the
 * attempted transition is not valid.

 * Tomcat 的架构设计是清晰的，模块化的，它拥有很多的组件，假如在启动Tomcat 时一个个组件启动，这不仅麻烦而且容易遗漏组件，还会对后面的
 * 动态组件扩展带来麻烦，对于这个问题，Tomcat的设计者们提供了一个解决方案，用Lifecycle 管理启动，停止，关闭。
 *
 * Tomcat 内部架构各个核心组件有包含与被包含的关系，假如 ，Servlet包含Service ，Service包含Container 和Connector ，往下再一层层
 * 包含，Tomcat 就是以容器的方式来组织整个系统架构，就像数据结构的树，树的根节点没有父节点，其他节点有且仅有一个父节点，每个父节点有零个
 * 或多个子节点，鉴于此，可以通过父容器启动它的子容器，这样只要启动根容器，即可把其他的容器都启动，达到统一，停止，关闭的效果 。
 *
 * 作为统一的接口，Lifecycle把所有的启动，停止，关闭，生命周期相关的方法组织在一起，就可以很方便的管理Tomcat 各个容器的生命周期，下面是Lifecycle接口详细的定义 。
 *
 * 从上面可以看出，Lifecycle其实就定义了一些状态常量和几个方法，这里主要看init ，start ，stop 三个方法，所需要的生命周期管理的容器都要实现这个接口。
 * 并且各自被父容器的相应调用方法，例如，在初始化阶段，根容器Server 组件会调用init方法，而在init方法里会调用子容器Service 组件的init 方法 。
 * 以此类推。
 *
 * 同样，启动，停止 步骤也是通过类似的调用机制实现统一的启动，统一的关闭，至此，我们对Tomcat 生命周期的统一初始化，启动，关闭机制有了比较清晰的认识。
